# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

- Dataset Link: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Preprocessing

The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and normalize the data.

## Model

A Random Forest Classifier was chosen as the model for prediction.

## Performance

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
